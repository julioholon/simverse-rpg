## Design Principles

### 1. **Roll-Under Simplicity**
The core mechanic is elegantly simple: roll 3d6 and try to get equal to or under your target number (Attribute + Skill + modifiers). The 3d6 bell curve ensures most rolls cluster around average (10-11) while keeping dramatic successes and failures rare and exciting.

### 2. **Meaningful Choices**
Every decision matters:
- **Combat** offers multiple defense options (dodge, parry, block) with distinct tactical advantages
- **Character Building** uses escalating costs that reward focused specialists while allowing versatile generalists
- **Resource Management** with Stamina (physical), Mana (magical), and Vitality (health) creates strategic depth

### 3. **Flexible Customization**
Build anything from a sword-and-sorcery warrior to a cyberpunk hacker:
- **Attributes** scale from 5 (severely impaired) to 30+ (godlike)
- **Skills** use Sum progression for diminishing returns
- **Powers** are constructed from modular enhancements and limitations

### 4. **Tactical Depth Without Complexity**
Combat features:
- **Initiative** based on Speed (reflexes and coordination)
- **Action Economy** with Major, Minor, and Reaction actions
- **Armor by Piece** with Deflection (AD) and Resistance (AR) values
- **Damage Types** (bludgeoning, cutting, impaling, energy) interact differently with armor
- **Called Shots** for targeting specific body parts with risk/reward trade-offs

### 5. **Unified Mechanics**
Spells, combat maneuvers, and psychic powers all use the same construction system with base tiers, percentage-based enhancements, and limitations. This consistency makes learning and balancing abilities straightforward.

## Quick Start Guide

### What You Need

- 3 six-sided dice (3d6)
- Character sheet (see [Simverse_Character_Sheet.md](Simverse_Character_Sheet.md))
- Pencil and paper
- 2-6 players (1 GM, 1-5 players)

### Core Mechanic Overview

**When you attempt something uncertain:**

1. **Roll 3d6**
2. **Compare to target number** (usually Attribute + Skill + modifiers)
3. **Equal to or under = Success** | **Over = Failure**

**Example:** Your character with Dexterity 12 and Swords skill 3 attacks an enemy. Your target number is 12 + 3 = 15. You roll 3d6 and get 12. Success! You hit.

**Margin of Success** = Target Number - Roll Result
Higher margins mean better performance and affect opposed rolls.

### Critical Results

- **Three 1s (1-1-1)** = Critical Success (+10 margin, exceptional outcome)
- **Three 6s (6-6-6)** = Critical Failure (-10 margin, automatic failure with complication)

### Basic Attributes

Characters have 7 attributes starting at 10 (human average):

**Major Attributes** (10 CP per level):
- **Dexterity (DX)** - Agility, coordination, ranged combat
- **Intellect (IN)** - Reasoning, learning, technical skills
- **Wisdom (WS)** - Willpower, mental defense, intuition
- **Charisma (CH)** - Social influence, leadership

**Minor Attributes** (5 CP per level):
- **Strength (ST)** - Physical power, melee damage
- **Endurance (EN)** - Health, stamina, resistance
- **Awareness (AW)** - Perception, initiative, luck

### Derived Statistics

- **Vitality** = EN × 2 (health/hit points)
- **Stamina** = ST × 2 (physical energy for maneuvers)
- **Mana** = AW × 2 (magical/mental energy)
- **Speed** = (DX + EN) / 4 (initiative and movement)
- **Perception** = (IN + AW) / 2 (notice things)

## Character Creation Example

Let's create **Lyra, an Elven Scout** using the standard starting budget (100 CP + 30 CP from flaws = 130 CP).

### Step 1: Choose Templates

**Elf Template** (50 CP):
- DX +2, AW +1, EN -1, ST -1
- Night Vision, Acute Senses (Hearing), Facilitated Movement (Forest), Graceful, Extended Lifespan

**Scout Template** (29 CP):
- Bow 3, Stealth 3, Tracking 3, Survival 2, Perception 2
- Acute Senses (choose one - we'll pick Sight)
- Light armor, bow, hunting knife, camping gear

**Total Spent:** 79 CP
**Remaining:** 51 CP

### Step 2: Set Attributes

Starting from baseline 10, applying racial modifiers:

- **DX:** 10 + 2 (racial) + 1 (10 CP) = **13**
- **IN:** 10 + 0 = **10**
- **WS:** 10 + 0 = **10**
- **CH:** 10 + 0 = **10**
- **ST:** 10 - 1 (racial) = **9**
- **EN:** 10 - 1 (racial) = **9**
- **AW:** 10 + 1 (racial) + 1 (5 CP) = **12**

**Spent:** 15 CP
**Remaining:** 36 CP

### Step 3: Calculate Derived Stats

- **Vitality:** 9 × 2 = **18 HP**
- **Stamina:** 9 × 2 = **18**
- **Mana:** 12 × 2 = **24**
- **Speed:** (13 + 9) / 4 = **5.5**
- **Perception:** (10 + 12) / 2 = **11**
- **Damage Bonus:** (9 - 10) / 2 = **-1** (round down)

### Step 4: Buy Perks

- **Acute Senses - Sight** (0 CP) - from Scout template
- **Quick Learner** (15 CP) - Learn skills 50% faster

**Spent:** 15 CP
**Remaining:** 21 CP

### Step 5: Improve Skills

Boosting key skills (from template base):
- **Bow:** 3 → 4 (+4 CP using sum formula: 10 total)
- **Stealth:** 3 → 4 (+4 CP using sum formula: 10 total)

**Spent:** 8 CP
**Remaining:** 13 CP

### Step 6: Combat Maneuvers

- **Aimed Shot** (3 CP) - +4 to hit after aiming
- **Precision Strike** (8 CP) - +2d6 damage with ranged weapons
- **Quick Draw** (1 CP) - Draw weapon as free action

**Spent:** 12 CP
**Remaining:** 1 CP

### Step 7: Take Flaws

To reach our 130 CP budget, we took flaws worth -30 CP:
- **Curious** (-10 CP) - Must roll WS to resist investigating
- **Code of Honor** (-10 CP) - Cannot attack helpless, must keep word
- **Overconfident** (-10 CP) - Struggles to back down from challenges

### Lyra's Final Stats

**Attributes:** DX 13, IN 10, WS 10, CH 10, ST 9, EN 9, AW 12
**Derived:** Vitality 18, Stamina 18, Mana 24, Speed 5.5, Perception 11
**Combat:** Bow +17 to hit (DX 13 + Bow 4), deals 2d6-1 damage (2d6 base +0 ST -1)
**Skills:** Bow 4, Stealth 4, Tracking 3, Survival 2, Perception 2
**Perks:** Night Vision, Acute Senses (Hearing & Sight), Forest Movement, Graceful, Quick Learner
**Maneuvers:** Aimed Shot, Precision Strike, Quick Draw
**Flaws:** Curious, Code of Honor, Overconfident

## Playing the Game

### Combat Example

**Round 1:**

**Initiative:** Lyra (Speed 5.5) vs Orc Raider (Speed 4.5) - Lyra acts first

**Lyra's Turn:**
1. **Major Action:** Use Aimed Shot maneuver (carefully aim at the orc)
2. **Minor Action:** Assess terrain
3. **Movement:** Half-move to better position (3 meters)

**Orc's Turn:**
1. **Major Action:** Full move toward Lyra (8 meters)
2. **Minor Action:** Draw axe
3. **Shout:** "You die, elf!"

**Round 2:**

**Lyra's Turn:**
1. **Major Action:** Fire arrow with Aimed Shot bonus from last turn
   - Target number: DX 13 + Bow 4 + Aimed bonus 4 = **21**
   - Roll 3d6: Gets **10** - Success with margin 11!
   - Orc must defend at -2 (margin 11 / 5 = 2.2, round down to -2)

**Orc's Defense:**
- Chooses to **Dodge** (DX 10 / 2 = 5, +1 for leather armor AD = 6, -2 for Lyra's margin = **4**)
- Rolls 3d6: Gets **7** - Failure! Arrow hits!

**Damage:**
- Bow base: 2d6 (impaling)
- ST bonus: +0 (ST 9)
- Roll: Gets 7 on 2d6 = **7 damage**
- Subtract 1 per die for impaling: 7 - 2 = 5
- Orc's leather torso AR 2: 5 - 2 = 3 gets through
- Impaling doubles penetrating damage: 3 × 2 = **6 Vitality damage**
- Orc takes 6 damage, now at 14/20 Vitality

**Orc's Turn:**
- Still too far away, charges closer...

### Skill Check Example

**Tracking a Thief:**

Lyra needs to track bandits through the forest.

- **Base:** AW 12 + Tracking 3 = **15** (Tracking can use AW or WS, she uses AW)
- **Modifiers:** Forest terrain (no penalty due to Facilitated Movement perk), recent rain makes tracks clearer (+2)
- **Final Target:** **17**
- **Roll:** 3d6 = **14**
- **Margin:** 17 - 14 = **3**

Success! Lyra picks up the trail. The margin of 3 means she gets good information - not just the direction but approximately how many people and how recently they passed.

### Social Encounter Example

**Persuading the Guard:**

Lyra tries to convince a city guard to let her pass after curfew.

- **Base:** CH 10 + Persuasion 0 (untrained = CH - 2) = **8**
- **Modifiers:** Guard is suspicious (-2), nighttime (-1)
- **Final Target:** **5**
- **Roll:** 3d6 = **9**
- **Result:** Failure by 4

The guard shakes his head. "Nice try, elf, but rules are rules. Come back in the morning or pay the fine."

Lyra could try a different approach (bribe, sneak past him using Stealth 17, or accept the fine).

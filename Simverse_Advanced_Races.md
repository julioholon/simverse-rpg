# SIMVERSE: Advanced Races
## Meta-Traits System for Non-Human Entities

---

## Introduction

This supplement deconstructs the baseline human physiology into modular meta-traits, allowing you to create truly alien and bizarre player characters: robots, undead, elementals, constructs, sentient plants, energy beings, and more.

### How This System Works

**Standard human physiology = 0 CP baseline**

Humans eat, breathe, sleep, bleed, feel emotions, have vital organs, etc. These traits are the default. This supplement lets you modify individual aspects:

- **Add traits**: Pay CP for advantages (immunity, special abilities)
- **Remove traits**: Pay CP to eliminate needs and vulnerabilities
- **Modify traits**: Change how basic systems work
- **Combine with existing systems**: Size modifiers, perks, flaws, templates

### Design Philosophy

The human baseline isn't "better" or "worse" - it's just the reference point. A robot that doesn't need food (+10 CP) trades flexibility (can't benefit from food-based healing) for reliability (never starves). The CP cost reflects power level, not moral judgment.

**Use Cases:**
- Building exotic race templates (sentient golems, vampire bloodlines, shapeshifters)
- Creating monsters and NPCs (elemental guardians, undead horrors)
- Playing truly alien characters (crystalline entities, living shadows, psychic parasites)
- Handling character transformations (becoming undead, cybernetic conversion, magical corruption)

## Meta-Trait Categories

Traits are organized into 8 categories:

1. **Metabolic Traits** - Food, water, air, sleep requirements
2. **Injury & Healing Traits** - Damage response and recovery
3. **Damage Resistances & Vulnerabilities** - Elemental and special damage
4. **Sensory Traits** - Vision, hearing, and exotic senses
5. **Cognitive & Emotional Traits** - Mind, emotions, free will
6. **Lifespan & Aging Traits** - Mortality and aging
7. **Locomotion Traits** - Flight, swimming, burrowing
8. **Special Physiology Traits** - Exotic body types

---

## Important: Vitality vs Integrity

**Living beings** use **Vitality** (EN × 2):
- 0 Vitality = unconscious
- -EN Vitality = dead
- -2×EN Vitality = body destroyed (beyond normal resurrection)
(the **Hard to Kill** perk allows staying conscious until full body destruction)

**Constructs/Robots/Unliving beings** use **Integrity** (EN × 2):
- 0 Integrity = glitches and malfunctions, random system failures
- -EN Integrity = complete shutdown (can be repaired with time)
- -2×EN Integrity = completely broken/destroyed (beyond normal repair, needs complete reconstruction)

**Note**: Constructs with Integrity cannot be "unconscious" - they either function (with glitches) or shut down completely.

---

## 1. Metabolic Traits

These traits govern basic survival needs.

### Doesn't Need Food (+10 CP)
- No need to eat
- Immune to starvation and hunger effects
- **Drawback**: Cannot benefit from food-based healing or stamina recovery (meals no longer restore stamina)
- **Justification**: Undead, constructs, beings of pure energy, photosynthetic entities

### Doesn't Need Water (+8 CP)
- No need to drink
- Immune to dehydration and thirst
- **Drawback**: Cannot benefit from water-based effects or potions that require drinking (unless GM allows other consumption methods)
- **Justification**: Mechanical beings, undead, desert-adapted entities, beings that absorb moisture from air

### Doesn't Need Air (+15 CP)
- Don't breathe
- Immune to suffocation, drowning, strangulation, gas attacks, and inhaled poisons
- Can operate underwater, in vacuum, or in toxic atmospheres indefinitely
- **Drawback**: Cannot benefit from breathing exercises, air-based healing, or alchemical inhalants
- **Justification**: Undead, constructs, water-breathing entities, beings with alternative respiration

### Doesn't Need Sleep (+12 CP)
- No need to sleep or enter rest state
- Immune to sleep spells, sleep deprivation, and exhaustion from lack of sleep
- Can remain alert and active 24 hours per day
- **Drawback**: Still require 8 hours of light activity (meditation, maintenance, low-power mode) as "long rest" to recover Vitality, but can keep watch, read, or perform simple tasks during this time
- **Justification**: Constructs, undead, beings of pure thought, certain magical entities

### Alternative Fuel (+0 to +10 CP, varies)
- Feed on specific substance instead of normal food
- **Common types**:
  - **Blood** (-5 CP): Must drink blood from living creatures. 1 pint per day, can store 3 days worth. Drinking blood in combat = Minor Action, restores 1d6 Vitality/Integrity if fresh from living creature.
  - **Life Energy Drain** (-10 CP): Drain life force from living beings via touch (1 minute contact = 1 "meal"). Resisted by WS. Victims lose 1d6 Vitality, you restore 1d6 Vitality/Integrity. Can be used in combat as unarmed attack.
  - **Vampiric Bite** (-10 CP): Must bite living creatures to drain blood. Bite attack (Brawling skill, 1d6-2 damage) that latches on. While latched, drain 1d6 Vitality per round, heal yourself for same amount. Victim can break grapple as normal. Requires fangs (may be retractable). Drinking blood is pleasant/addictive (WS roll to stop voluntarily). Counts as Alternative Fuel source.
  - **Sunlight/Photosynthesis** (+8 CP): Need 4 hours of sunlight per day. After 3 days without sun, begin starving. +2 to EN while in direct sunlight. May have plant-like features (green skin, chlorophyll).
  - **Electricity** (+5 CP): Need 1 hour connected to electrical source per day. Can drain batteries, power sources. In high-tech settings, widely available.
  - **Emotions** (+0 CP): Feed on strong emotions within 10m. Must be in presence of emotional events (combat, celebrations, grief) for 1 hour per day.
  - **Metal/Minerals** (-5 CP): Consume metal or stone. 1 lb per day. Cheap and widely available but socially awkward.
  - **Mana** (+5 CP): Consume 2 Mana per day instead of eating. Can drain own Mana pool or external sources (ley lines, magic items).
- **Pricing Guide**:
  - +5-10 if more available and not noticeable
  - +0 CP if equally available and easy as food
  - -5 CP if equally available but awkward / noticeable
  - -10 CP if more rare or requires conflict, victims or very special circumstances
- **Combine**: Has to be paired with "Doesn't Need Food", unless the being can select both types of fuel

### Reduced Metabolism (+5 CP)
- Need food/water/sleep at 1/10th normal rate
- Eat once per week, drink once per 3 days, sleep 1 night per week
- Excellent for long journeys, space travel, or playing patient entities

- Extremely hard to kill with precision strikes
- **Justification**: Distributed anatomy (octopus, slime), homogeneous body (ooze, elemental), mechanical construction (all parts equally important), plant biology

### No Natural Healing (-20 CP)
- Cannot heal Vitality/Integrity naturally over time
- Long rest does NOT restore Vitality/Integrity
- Must use magic, mechanical repair, necromancy, regeneration chambers, or other special methods
- **Common workarounds**:
  - Healing spells still work (unless also taking "Unliving")
  - Repair skill for constructs (use Engineering skill, 1 hour = restore EN Integrity)
  - Necromantic energy for undead
  - Special maintenance procedures
- **Justification**: Undead, constructs, cursed entities, certain magical conditions

- Cure Wounds, Lay on Hands, healing potions, regeneration spells, etc. have no effect
- **Still allows**: Mechanical repair (for constructs), necromantic healing (for undead), or other specific healing methods appropriate to your physiology
- **Justification**: Constructs, undead, beings not powered by life force, magical curse
- **Note**: This is a major limitation for any character, but constructs/undead have alternative healing methods

### Modular Construction (+20 CP)
- Body is designed to be disassembled and repaired
- Can replace damaged parts with new components
- **Benefit**: When healed via Repair skill, restore 1.5× normal Vitality (multiply result by 1.5)
- Can swap out limbs, organs, or components (find replacement parts)
- **Drawback**: Critical hits have 25% chance to destroy a component (roll 1d4, on 4 = need replacement part to restore that limb's function)

## Creating Custom Race Templates with Meta-Traits

When building a race template using meta-traits:

1. **Start with concept**: What is the race? (Robot, vampire, elemental, etc.)

2. **List required traits**: What makes them fundamentally different from humans?
   - Don't need food/water/air/sleep?
   - Different injury response?
   - Special senses?
   - Unique physiology?

3. **Add advantages and disadvantages**:
   - Resistances/vulnerabilities
   - Special abilities
   - Limitations

4. **Calculate total CP cost**:
   - Add up all meta-traits
   - Add attribute modifiers (if any)
   - Add perks and flaws
   - Add starting skills (if profession template)

5. **Balance check**:
   - Most race templates should cost 25-60 CP
   - Exotic races can cost up to 100 CP for high-powered games
   - If cost is too high, add more disadvantages
   - If cost is negative (you gain CP), add more advantages or reduce drawbacks

6. **Playability check**:
   - Can this character function in a party?
   - Are the limitations too restrictive for player fun?
   - Does it break the game? (GM veto power)

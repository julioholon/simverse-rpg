### BACKGROUND
Marcus "Shadowstep" grew up in the slums of Port Haven, learning early that quick fingers and quicker feet meant survival. After years of petty theft, he joined the Silk Fingers gang, where his exceptional talent for infiltration earned him recognition. A high-stakes heist on the Merchants' Guild went sideways when his partner Silk betrayed him, framing Marcus for murdering a guard. Now wanted with a 500 sp bounty, Marcus fled Port Haven and turned to "legitimate" treasure hunting.

His skills are too valuable for most adventuring parties to care about his criminal past, and he's proven himself a reliable scout and infiltrator. Still, old habits die hard - he can't resist casing every building he enters and checking for valuables. Deep down, he dreams of clearing his name and maybe finding enough treasure to retire somewhere warm where guards don't know his face.

**Personality:**
- Charming but cautious, always analyzing exits
- Quick-witted with a sarcastic sense of humor
- Loyal to those who prove trustworthy
- Paranoid about betrayal (for good reason)

**Goals:**
- Clear his name in Port Haven (or at least outlive the warrant)
- Retire wealthy enough to never steal again
- Find the legendary Shadow Vaults
- Get revenge on Silk Fingers for the betrayal

**Quirks:**
- Checks every door for traps (twice)
- Keeps emergency coin sewn into clothing
- Never sits with back to entrance
- Whistles softly when nervous

**Allies:**
- **Raven** - Thieves' guild information broker, neutral toward Marcus
- **Old Marko** - Fence who buys "acquired" goods, no questions asked
- **Lyra the Knife** - Former gang member who still owes Marcus a favor

**Enemies:**
- **Captain Hendrik** - Port Haven guard captain, knows Marcus's face, determined
- **Silk Fingers** - Rival thief who framed Marcus, now leads the gang
- **The Merchants' Guild** - Posted the bounty, long memory

These three characters form a well-balanced adventuring party:

- Holds the line with high AC and Vitality
- Protects squishier party members
- Controls enemies with Shield Bash and Stunning Blow
- Can take massive punishment (Hard to Kill falls uncounsious at -37 Vitality)

**Lyralei Moonwhisper** - Ranged Damage & Utility
- Provides consistent ranged damage (Magic Missile never misses)
- Utility casting (Invisibility, Dispel, Detect Magic)
- Shield Spell makes her surprisingly durable
- Night Vision helps party in dark dungeons

**Marcus Shadowstep** - Scout & Skill Specialist
- Scouts ahead with high Stealth
- Disables traps and picks locks
- Flanks for devastating Sneak Attacks
- Fast Healer means quick recovery between fights

## Combat Tactics
1. **Marcus** scouts ahead, identifies threats
2. **Thorin** engages frontline, uses Shield Bash/Stunning Blow to control
3. **Lyralei** targets with Magic Missile (never misses) or Fire Bolt
4. **Marcus** flanks for Sneak Attack (+2d6 damage)
5. If overwhelmed: Lyralei casts Invisibility, party retreats

## Skill Coverage
- **Combat:** Thorin (master), Marcus (flanker), Lyralei (ranged)
- **Social:** Marcus (Deception/Intimidation), Thorin (Leadership)

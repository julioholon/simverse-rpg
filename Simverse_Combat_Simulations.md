  - AR reduces: 1-8 = 0 damage (visor deflects the thrust!)
  - **Aldric: 31/35 Vitality** (armor holds again!)

  - **Kael: 0/24 Vitality - DOWN!**
- **Dying:** Kael collapses, bleeding out

**Combat Ends:**
- **Ser Aldric victorious** (31/35 Vitality, barely wounded)
- **Kael defeated** (0/24 Vitality, dying, rolling vs EN to stabilize)

**Combat Analysis:**
- Lasted 4 rounds (about 24 seconds)
- High skill levels meant most attacks connected, but armor made the difference
- **Aldric's plate armor (AR 8) was DECISIVE** - rapier penetrated only ONCE (Precision Strike headshot in Round 2)
- Light impaling weapons (rapier 1d6) are nearly useless against heavy armor without special maneuvers
- Kael's only successful damage: 4 Vitality from Precision Strike (ignoring 2 AR) + headshot multiplier
- Power Attack maneuver turned the tide with massive 14 damage cutting attack
- Bleeding damage (3 Vitality over 3 rounds) contributed significantly to Kael's defeat
- **Key lesson:** Weapon and armor selection matters MORE than skill at high levels

## KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM SIMULATIONS

### Novice Combat
- Low skill/damage means longer fights
- Armor becomes very important even at low levels
- Morale often ends fights before death
- Minimum damage rule keeps combat moving

### Veteran Combat
- High skills mean most attacks hit, but armor determines success
- **Armor type selection is MORE important than skill** (Aldric's AR 8 plate vs Kael's AR 2 leather)
- Light impaling weapons (1d6 rapier) are nearly useless against heavy armor (AR 8)
- Precision Strike maneuver was essential - only way to damage heavily armored opponent
- Single powerful hits (Power Attack 14 damage) more decisive than many weak hits (0 damage)
- Maneuvers (Power Attack, Precision Strike) are fight-winners
- Bleeding damage adds up quickly (3 Vitality over 3 rounds)
- **New impaling rules make armor MORE effective** - minimum damage applies before AR, then AR can reduce to 0

### Group Combat
- Buff spells (Bless +2) are extremely powerful
- Focused fire on key targets works
- Morale checks cascade through groups
- Surprise rounds are devastating
- Coordinated tactics beat individual heroics
- Support characters (healers, buffers) enable victory
